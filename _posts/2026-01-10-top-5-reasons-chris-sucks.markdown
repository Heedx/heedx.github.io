Recently my nemesis chris made a [website][chris-web] that was completely defamatory and ruins my character. Here's 3 reasons why this person is not to be trusted

# 1  - His name is too short.
Chris is 5 letters, Daniel is 6 letters, which is objectively a better number.

# 2 - His coding style is wack.
Take a look at this coding snippet I found on his computer

{% highlight python %}
def evenoDd(number):
    if number is 0:
        return 'even'
    elif number is 1:
        return 'odd'
    elif number is 2:
        return 'even'
    elif number is 3:
        return 'odd'
    else:
        return 'out of range'
{% endhighlight %}

Bro can't even code correctly. Look at that function name. Out of range on an even-odd function?!

# 3 - Amateur Web Designer
Look at his [website][chris-web]. He's clearly a little script kiddy who thinks ripping themes off of google is good enough. He has no taste. His taste is on par with a 16 year old at the lamborgini dealership using his parents money. Clearly untrustworthy.
